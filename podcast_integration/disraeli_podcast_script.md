# Words in Context Strategy: The Disraeli Question

**TUTOR:** What word in this passage tells us what kind of influences we need?

**STUDENT:** "Tension"?

**TUTOR:** Exactly. What creates tension?

**STUDENT:** Different things that don't work together.

**TUTOR:** Right. Now look at the colon - it's giving us examples. Are Victorian politics, Romantic literature, and Jewish-British identity similar?

**STUDENT:** No, completely different.

**TUTOR:** Perfect. So we need a word meaning "different types." Check choice A - "harmonious."

**STUDENT:** Wait, harmonious means they work together. That contradicts tension.

**TUTOR:** Red flag! Choice B - "integrated"?

**STUDENT:** Same problem - no tension if they're integrated.

**TUTOR:** Choice D - "uniform"?

**STUDENT:** The examples prove they're not uniform.

**TUTOR:** That leaves C - "heterogeneous." Break it down: hetero means different, geneous means types.

**STUDENT:** So different types of influences create tension, making his writing distinctive!

**TUTOR:** Perfect. Key pattern: details after the colon define your answer. Tension requires difference.
