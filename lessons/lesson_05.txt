Without them, writing feels choppy and disconnected.\nConcept Box: Types of Transition Relationships\n    ‚Ä¢ ‚ûï **Addition** - Furthermore, additionally, moreover, also\n    ‚Ä¢ üîÑ **Contrast** - However, nevertheless, on the other hand, yet\n    ‚Ä¢ üìà **Cause/Effect** - Therefore, consequently, as a result, thus\n    ‚Ä¢ üìù **Example** - For instance, specifically, namely, such as\nExamples:\n    without: Solar energy is renewable. It reduces carbon emissions. It saves money on electricity bills.\n    with: Solar energy is renewable. Furthermore, it reduces carbon emissions and saves money on electricity bills.\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: reveal_on_click\n    Trigger: Click to see the difference\n    Reveal: Notice how 'Furthermore' connects the ideas and shows they're building on each other, rather than just listing separate facts.\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_03\nType: strategy_teaching\nTitle: The FLOW Method for Transitions\nDuration: 300 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Strategy: Create Seamless Connections\nStrategy Steps:\n    Step 1: FOLLOW the logic\n        Identify the relationship between ideas\n        Example: Idea 1: Exercise improves health. Idea 2: It reduces stress. ‚Üí Addition relationship\n    Step 2: LOCATE the best transition\n        Choose words that match the logical relationship\n        Example: Addition: Additionally, exercise reduces stress and improves mental well-being.\n    Step 3: ORDER for maximum impact\n        Place transitions where they'll guide readers most effectively\n        Example: Usually at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs for clear signaling\n    Step 4: WEAVE naturally\n        Ensure transitions feel organic, not forced\n        Example: Avoid overusing transitions - sometimes ideas connect naturally without them\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: step_by_step_reveal\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_04\nType: concept_teaching\nTitle: Advanced Transition Strategies\nDuration: 280 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Beyond Basic Connectors\nText:\n    Sophisticated transitions do more than connect - they clarify relationships and enhance meaning.\nConcept Box: Advanced Techniques\n    ‚Ä¢ üîó **Transitional phrases** - In light of this evidence, Given these circumstances\n    ‚Ä¢ üìç **Referential transitions** - This approach, Such strategies, These findings\n    ‚Ä¢ ‚è±Ô∏è **Temporal markers** - Meanwhile, Subsequently, Before long, Eventually\n    ‚Ä¢ üéØ **Emphasis transitions** - Indeed, In fact, Notably, Most importantly\nExamples:\n    basic: The experiment failed. However, we learned valuable lessons.\n    advanced: The experiment failed to produce expected results. This setback, however, provided valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms.\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: reveal_on_click\n    Trigger: Click for sophistication tip\n    Reveal: Advanced transitions often reference specific content ('This setback') rather than just showing logical relationships, making connections clearer and more precise.\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_05\nType: guided_example\nTitle: Guided Practice: Fix the Flow\nDuration: 360 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Let's Improve This Passage Together\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: guided_walkthrough\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_06\nType: independent_practice\nTitle: Your Turn: Perfect the Flow\nDuration: 300 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Independent Practice\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: multiple_choice_question\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_07\nType: concept_reinforcement\nTitle: Key Takeaways\nDuration: 180 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Transition Mastery Summary\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: completion_celebration\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_08\nType: mastery_check\nTitle: Mastery Check\nDuration: 240 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Final Assessment\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: mastery_assessment\n---\n\n================================================================================\nEND OF LESSON\n================================================================================\n\nEDITING INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Edit any text content directly\n- Keep the structure markers (##, ---, etc.)\n- Don't change IDs unless creating a new lesson\n- Save and use text_to_json to convert back
