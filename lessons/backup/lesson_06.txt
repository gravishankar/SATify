First, early devices combined phones with PDAs. Then, touchscreens revolutionized the interface.\n    problem_solution: Urban traffic congestion costs billions annually. Cities are implementing smart traffic systems to optimize flow and reduce delays.\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: reveal_on_click\n    Trigger: Click to see structure signals\n    Reveal: Look for signal words: chronological (first, next, finally), compare/contrast (however, similarly), cause/effect (therefore, as a result).\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_03\nType: strategy_teaching\nTitle: The MAPS Method for Structure Analysis\nDuration: 320 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Strategy: Navigate Any Text Structure\nStrategy Steps:\n    Step 1: MAIN IDEA - Identify the central point\n        What is the author's primary message or argument?\n        Example: Climate change requires immediate global action ‚Üí Main idea established\n    Step 2: ARRANGE - Find the organizational pattern\n        How does the author organize supporting information?\n        Example: Problem (climate effects) ‚Üí Solution (renewable energy) ‚Üí Problem/Solution pattern\n    Step 3: PURPOSE - Understand why this structure\n        Why did the author choose this organizational approach?\n        Example: Problem/Solution structure persuades readers that action is both necessary and possible\n    Step 4: SUPPORT - Analyze how ideas are developed\n        What evidence, examples, or details support the main points?\n        Example: Statistics, expert quotes, and case studies strengthen the argument\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: step_by_step_reveal\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_04\nType: concept_teaching\nTitle: Analyzing Development Strategies\nDuration: 300 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: How Authors Build Their Ideas\nText:\n    Beyond organizational patterns, authors use specific strategies to develop and strengthen their points throughout a text.\nConcept Box: Development Strategies\n    ‚Ä¢ üìö **Examples & Illustrations** - Concrete instances that clarify abstract concepts\n    ‚Ä¢ üìä **Data & Statistics** - Numerical evidence to support claims\n    ‚Ä¢ üë®‚Äçüî¨ **Expert Opinion** - Authoritative voices to add credibility\n    ‚Ä¢ üìñ **Anecdotes & Stories** - Personal narratives to engage readers\n    ‚Ä¢ üîç **Definition & Explanation** - Clear terminology and clarification\n    ‚Ä¢ ‚öñÔ∏è **Acknowledgment of Counterarguments** - Addressing opposing views\nExamples:\n    weak_development: Social media is harmful. It causes problems. People should use it less.\n    strong_development: Social media platforms have documented negative effects on teen mental health (data). Dr. Smith's research shows increased anxiety rates (expert opinion). Take Sarah, who experienced cyberbullying (anecdote). However, social media also provides valuable connections (counterargument acknowledgment).\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: reveal_on_click\n    Trigger: Click for development evaluation tip\n    Reveal: Strong development uses multiple strategies and provides specific, relevant support rather than vague generalizations.\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_05\nType: guided_example\nTitle: Guided Practice: Structure Detective\nDuration: 400 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Let's Analyze This Passage Together\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: guided_walkthrough\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_06\nType: concept_teaching\nTitle: Structure and Purpose Connection\nDuration: 260 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Why Structure Matters\nText:\n    Authors don't choose organizational patterns randomly - each structure serves specific purposes and creates particular effects on readers.\nConcept Box: Structure-Purpose Relationships\n    ‚Ä¢ ‚è∞ **Chronological** ‚Üí Shows development over time, emphasizes progress or change\n    ‚Ä¢ ‚öñÔ∏è **Compare/Contrast** ‚Üí Highlights differences, helps readers make informed choices\n    ‚Ä¢ üîß **Problem/Solution** ‚Üí Persuades readers that action is needed and possible\n    ‚Ä¢ üîÑ **Cause/Effect** ‚Üí Demonstrates relationships, predicts outcomes\n    ‚Ä¢ üìê **General to Specific** ‚Üí Builds understanding from broad concepts to details\nExamples:\n    scientific: A research paper uses general-to-specific structure to guide readers from broad hypothesis to detailed experimental results.\n    persuasive: An editorial uses problem/solution structure to convince readers that a proposed policy change is necessary and beneficial.\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: reveal_on_click\n    Trigger: Click for SAT connection\n    Reveal: On the SAT, questions often ask why an author chose a particular structure or how it serves their purpose - understanding these connections is crucial.\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_07\nType: independent_practice\nTitle: Your Turn: Structure Analysis\nDuration: 360 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Independent Practice\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: multiple_choice_question\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_08\nType: concept_reinforcement\nTitle: Key Takeaways\nDuration: 200 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Text Structure Mastery Summary\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: completion_celebration\n---\n\n## SLIDE: slide_09\nType: mastery_check\nTitle: Mastery Check\nDuration: 300 seconds\n\n### CONTENT\nHeading: Final Assessment\n### INTERACTIONS\nType: mastery_assessment\n---\n\n================================================================================\nEND OF LESSON\n================================================================================\n\nEDITING INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Edit any text content directly\n- Keep the structure markers (##, ---, etc.)\n- Don't change IDs unless creating a new lesson\n- Save and use text_to_json to convert back
