The Main Quest
* Decode the flow 
 * Define the logical bridge.
   * Apply key strategies connecting ideas effectively
Slide 2: What are Transitions?
ID: slide_02
Transitions = Seamless Connections
Step 1: FOLLOW the Logical Flow
Identify the relationship between ideas in sentences
Example: Idea 1: Exercise improves health. Idea 2: It reduces stress. → Addition relationship
Step 2: LOCATE the best transition
Choose words that match the logical relationship
Example: Addition: Additionally, exercise reduces stress and improves mental well-being.

Type: concept_teaching
Duration: 240 seconds
Before checking choices…
 * Step 1 (Context First): 
* Simplify the text
* Ditch the noise 
* Get to the core of logic 
 * Step 2 (Predict):
* Guess a basic answer.
 * Step 3 (Flaw-Finding): Find the specific flaw in three answers.
Slide 4: Strategy First
Define the Context

Type: strategy_teaching
Duration: 300 seconds
* Goal: Identify the precise logical relationship.
 * Step 1 (Idea A): Paraphrase the sentence before the blank.
   * Tactic: Ditch the Details. Ignore jargon, names, or numbers.
 * Step 2 (Idea B): Paraphrase the sentence after the blank.

Most Common Red Flags & Logical Traps.
| Logical Trap / Red Flag | How the Strategy Addresses It |
|---|---|
| Trap 1: Choosing a word that "vibes" right. | Core Principle 1: "Move from 'feels right' to 100% provable (no cap)." |
| Trap 2: Getting fooled by complex details. | Slide 3, Tactic: "Ditch the Details." The focus is only on the simple, main ideas (Idea A and Idea B). |
| Trap 3: Distinguishing between synonyms. | Slide 4, Tactic 3 (Copycats): If two choices are synonyms, they usually cancel each other out. This forces you to look for a flaw in both. |
| Trap 4: Picking a word that is close but not perfect. | Slide 4, Tactic 1 (Rhetorical Purpose Check): The word must match the author’s precise intent—no general vibes allowed! |
| Trap 5: The answer is technically correct, but not the best option. | Slide 4, Tactic 2 (Precision Tie-breaker): Forces you to choose the most specific connection every time. |
