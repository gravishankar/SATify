Initially, electric cars faced significant challenges: limited range, long charging times, and high costs deterred consumers. However, recent advances have addressed these concerns. Battery technology has improved dramatically, with some vehicles now traveling over 300 miles on a single charge. Charging infrastructure has expanded rapidly, making long-distance travel feasible. Most importantly, government incentives and falling battery costs have made electric vehicles increasingly affordable. As a result, sales have surged from 50,000 units in 2012 to over 300,000 in 2021. This trend suggests that electric vehicles will soon become mainstream, fundamentally transforming the automotive industry.",

Research reveals a more complex picture. Studies show that procrastination stems from emotional regulation issues rather than time management problems. When faced with tasks that trigger negative emotions—boredom, anxiety, or frustration—people delay to avoid these feelings. This pattern creates a cycle: temporary relief from negative emotions reinforces the procrastination behavior, making it more likely to occur again. Understanding this emotional component suggests new approaches to overcoming procrastination. Instead of focusing solely on time management techniques, effective strategies should address the emotional triggers that lead to delay.",

      "question": "The concept of sustainable cities has evolved significantly over the past two decades. Initially, urban planners focused primarily on reducing energy consumption through green buildings and efficient transportation. While these efforts produced modest improvements, they failed to address the fundamental challenge of urban growth. Cities continued expanding outward, consuming natural habitats and requiring extensive infrastructure. Recently, however, a new approach has emerged: the '15-minute city' concept. This model organizes urban areas so residents can access most daily needs—work, school, healthcare, and recreation—within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has championed this approach, transforming neighborhoods by adding bike lanes, local businesses, and community services. Early results are promising: reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and stronger community connections. Barcelona and Melbourne have implemented similar strategies with comparable success. This shift from efficiency-focused to accessibility-focused planning represents a paradigm change in sustainable urban development.\n\nThe passage is structured primarily to:",
