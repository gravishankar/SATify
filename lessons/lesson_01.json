While most people associate this ability with fireflies, bioluminescence is actually most common in marine environments, where up to 90% of organisms in the deep ocean produce their own light. This biological lighting serves various purposes: some species use it to attract prey, others to communicate with potential mates, and still others to confuse or deter predators. Recent research has revealed that bioluminescence evolved independently at least 40 times throughout natural history, suggesting that the ability to produce light provides significant survival advantages. Scientists are now studying these natural light-producing mechanisms to develop new biotechnologies, including more efficient lighting systems and medical imaging techniques.",

Although the initial setup costs are substantial, vertical farms can produce up to 390 times more food per square foot than traditional farms.

      "question": "The concept of 'flow'—a psychological state of complete immersion and focus—was first introduced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in the 1970s. When experiencing flow, individuals report losing track of time, feeling effortlessly concentrated, and performing at their peak ability. This state occurs when there's a perfect balance between the challenge level of a task and a person's skill level: too easy, and boredom sets in; too difficult, and anxiety takes over. Flow has been observed across diverse activities, from athletic performance to artistic creation to professional work. Understanding flow has practical applications for education, workplace productivity, and personal fulfillment. By designing activities that promote flow states, teachers can enhance student engagement, managers can improve employee satisfaction, and individuals can achieve greater happiness and accomplishment in their daily lives.\n\nThe passage primarily serves to:",
      "options": [
        "define the concept of flow and explain its applications for improving human performance and satisfaction",
        "argue that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's research on flow should be more widely recognized",
        "compare flow states experienced in athletic activities versus artistic endeavors",
        "demonstrate that achieving flow requires finding the perfect balance between challenge and skill"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phase 3 Elimination:\n\nA: ✓ CORRECT—Topic: flow concept. Purpose: to define and explain applications. Covers whole passage (definition, characteristics, conditions, applications across domains).\n\nB: WRONG PURPOSE trap—Author explains flow, doesn't argue researcher needs recognition. No 'should,' no advocacy.\n\nC: WRONG STRUCTURE trap—Passage mentions athletics and arts as examples but doesn't compare them. Focus is on defining flow and explaining applications.\n\nD: TOO NARROW trap—Balance of challenge/skill is ONE condition for flow (mentioned in middle), not the main idea of entire passage. Misses the applications focus in second half."
