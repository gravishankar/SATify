Passage describes THIS application only.\n\nB: ✓ CORRECT—One step from evidence. Repetitive checking + inability to sleep directly suggests anxiety about results. No extreme language, fully supported.\n\nC: ✗ FUTURE PREDICTION + FALSE CAUSATION—'definitely' unsupported. Early application doesn't guarantee acceptance.\n\nD: ✗ OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE—Past rejections not mentioned or implied. Adds information not in passage."
