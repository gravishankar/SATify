Further, the comma after &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after &ldquo;app,&rdquo; and the comma after &ldquo;network&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after &ldquo;TV&rdquo; to set off the supplemental elements (&ldquo;Chickasaw Basic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chickasaw TV&rdquo;) that provide the names of the app and the TV network, respectively. Altogether, the punctuation in this choice results in a sentence that clearly indicates that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the comma after &ldquo;2009&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t match the semicolon used to separate the second and third items in the complex series. </p>","question_type":"mcq"},{"uId":"fb96fa1e-a430-4e47-98ed-974787de6043","questionId":"bd11fe93","module":"reading-writing","primary_class_cd_desc":"Standard English Conventions","skill_cd":"FSS","skill_desc":"Form, Structure, and Sense","difficulty":"E","score_band_range_cd":1,"stem_html":"<p>Dr. Roc&iacute;o Paola Caballero-Gill is a paleoceanographer.
