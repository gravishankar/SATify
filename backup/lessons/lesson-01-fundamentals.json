          "title": "Why It's Tricky",
          "text": "The most fundamental skill in SAT Reading is distinguishing between what the author's main point is versus the specific details they use to support that point. This sounds simple, but test makers deliberately create wrong answers that look appealing.",
          "explanation": "Answers look appealing because they lift words from the passage but distort scope or focus on a minor detail.",
          "example": "If the passage argues renewable energy is *promising but challenging*, a trap might claim it 'solves all climate problems' — too broad.",
          "strategy": {
            "name": "Topic Sentence Strategy",
            "steps": [
              "Step 1: Ask after each paragraph — 'Why is the author telling me this?'",
              "Step 2: Predict the main idea in 5–7 words before answer choices",
              "Step 3: Eliminate answers that exaggerate or miss the scope",
              "Step 4: Confirm the correct answer is supported in at least 2 places"
            ]
          },
          "trapAlerts": [
            "Too broad - answer choice expands beyond what the passage actually claims",
            "Too narrow - answer choice focuses on one detail rather than the whole passage",
            "Outside the text - answer choice brings in information not discussed in the passage"

              "passage": "Scientists have recently discovered that urban gardens not only provide fresh produce for city residents but also help reduce air pollution and create habitats for beneficial insects. While these gardens require initial investment and ongoing maintenance, cities that have implemented community garden programs report improved neighborhood cohesion and reduced grocery costs for participants.",

              "choices": [
                "A) Urban gardens completely solve food insecurity in cities",
                "B) Community gardens provide multiple benefits despite requiring investment",

              "correct": "B",

              "passage": "The resurgence of vinyl records in the digital age presents a fascinating paradox. Despite the convenience and portability of digital music, vinyl sales have grown consistently over the past decade. Music enthusiasts cite the 'warmth' of analog sound and the ritual of playing records as key attractions. However, this revival isn't merely nostalgic—younger generations, who never experienced vinyl's original era, now represent the largest segment of buyers. Record stores report that these new collectors appreciate both the tactile experience and the intentional listening that vinyl encourages, contrasting sharply with the background consumption typical of digital streaming.",

              "explanation": "Choice C captures the passage's main point about the vinyl revival involving both traditional appreciation (older enthusiasts) and new motivations (younger buyers seeking intentional listening). A is too extreme ('failed'), B focuses on one detail (sound quality), and D mischaracterizes the younger generation's motivations."

Researchers found that people who frequently switch between tasks take longer to complete each individual task and make more errors. The brain, it appears, requires time to refocus when transitioning between different types of activities. However, not all task-switching is equally problematic. Simple, routine tasks can often be combined effectively, while complex cognitive work suffers significantly from interruption.",

                "A) Promote multitasking as an essential modern skill",
                "B) Argue that all forms of task-switching reduce productivity",

              "correct": "C",

              "passage": "Marine biologists studying coral reef ecosystems have discovered that certain fish species serve as 'cleaners,' removing parasites from larger fish. This symbiotic relationship benefits both parties: the cleaner fish obtain food, while their clients receive health benefits. What's remarkable is that these cleaning stations operate on a form of 'trust'—predator fish that would normally eat the cleaners instead patiently wait to be serviced. Some researchers argue this behavior demonstrates basic economic principles in nature, including service quality, customer loyalty, and even 'cheating' when cleaners take bites of healthy tissue instead of just parasites.",

                "A) Cleaner fish have evolved to be immune to predator attacks",
                "B) Coral reefs contain the most complex ecosystems on Earth",

              "explanation": "The passage describes cleaning relationships but emphasizes how they demonstrate economic principles in nature (trust, service quality, customer loyalty, cheating). A is not mentioned, B is too broad, and D mischaracterizes marine biology research focus."
