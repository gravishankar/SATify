## What Makes This Tricky
Errors can be subtle, especially with commas, pronouns, and verb tense.

## Strategy Steps
1. Read the whole sentence
2. Identify the grammar rule
3. Eliminate incorrect structures
4. Choose the clear, correct option

## Example Question
Each of the players (was/were) ready to begin.
