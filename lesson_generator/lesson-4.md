# SAT Skill: Craft and Structure

## What’s Tested
Understanding meaning, tone, and structure in context.

## What Makes This Tricky
Words may have multiple meanings; only one fits the passage.

## Strategy Steps
1. Read before and after
2. Predict your own word
3. Test options in context

## Example Question
The scientist’s approach was less (unique/derivative/awed/empathetic) than others.

## Walkthrough
Correct: "derivative" → contrasts with "unique".  
Traps: "awed" / "empathetic" don’t fit tone.

## Wrap-up
Tip: Always test the choice in the sentence.
